WatchFlix is a clone of the media-streaming Titan Netflix. WatchFlix allows users to view Movies and TV Shows at their leisure.Each User also has the ability to add Movies/Tv Shows to his/hers list which is unique to that user. It is built using Ruby on Rails for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and React & Redux for the frontend. The website is hosted on Heroku while the media is stored on AWS.
